## CODE-0.1 regression gate

Date: 2026-11-02

Tested baseline commit:

`a58766f3340716d2b71102fe0b855264f8e88288`

Commands:

```bash
npm test
npm run build:browser
```

Observed result:

- 21 tests passed
- 0 failed
- 0 skipped
- Maya acceptance journey: PASS
- Leila acceptance journey: PASS
- Jordan acceptance journey: PASS
- all four frozen micro-tests: PASS
- all direct reducer/invariant/persistence/shell unit tests: PASS
- TypeScript kernel build: PASS
- separate browser TypeScript build: PASS

The gate was executed against a local reconstruction of the exact GitHub commit contents using Node 22.16.0 and TypeScript 5.8.3 after the runtime's direct network path to GitHub was unavailable.

CODE-0.1 is therefore frozen. The next phase is usability work outside the kernel; the state machine remains closed unless the Change Gate is explicitly reopened.
